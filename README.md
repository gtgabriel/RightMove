# RightMove

This little api allows one to scrape house prices around London in various Locations (as defined in the dict inside the rm.py module). You can add more locations by using rightmove in a browser and observing the codes they use for each location choice in the UK, and adding that location code to the location dictionary. 

The 10 example locations given in the code are train stations. The house prices extracted are for 3 bedroom houses within 1 mile radius of each of those stations. These parameters can be adjusted in the jupyter notebook where the api is being called. 

The house prices have been sampled at a few points in time and saved for visualisation in google docs:

The idea behind this personal project was to monitor significant trends in house prices; now ( March 2020 ) I plan to also use this to see the impact of Corona virus on the housing market. 

Enjoy!
